# AI My Best Friend Genie
Perfect for asking school questions, asking for advice or just when you need a pick me up. This little Genie in a box is what you need to feel better and get the information you need.

# Features
Text message like framework. Uses Kendo-React.

# Child Safety Features
DOUBLE LAYER OF PROTECTION for child users. User enter text is sent though a moderation engine to check for any sexual, violent or other inappropriate text. Only if it passes that check will it get a response from the AI. A second level of validation is added to the AI's response which is also checked for safety content.
